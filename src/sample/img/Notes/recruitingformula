1. GeneratePLY(exact amt of seniors wit positions?)
	gen starrating (40-50 = UR(0), 50-60 = 1, 60-70 = 2, 70-80=3, 80-90= 4, 90-100=5)

2. Make offers
 	loop through team needs and offer;

 3. gen interest formula
 		(star rating vs team prestige), (team needs), (wins/currentwins), (rand)
 		ex. if team needs get met & player star rating less or the same then the signed players then offer withdrawn.../ interest lost
 		but if star rating is higher maintain offer;

4. each week random signings
		adjust interests;
		each team required to offer minimum amt of position requirements so if they need 2 qbs and are recuriitng two but lose one then offer another.


 end. finalize rec

 make sure all teams needs are met.
